	<h3>Who am I?</h3>
	<p>Hello friend! I’m Hakan, a developer based in Istanbul, a recent graduate of Boğaziçi University Foreign Language Education Department, and a huge Tron nerd who thinks Disney made a big mistake by not giving the green light for the third movie.</p>

	<h3>What do I do?</h3>
	<p>I'm a full-stack web developer who works with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, MSSQL, MySQL, and many other modern web technologies. In my professional work, I think programmatically about complex business problems and create web based solutions to those problems. Apart from my current tech stack, I worked with other technologies in the past such as Node.js, React, MongoDB, Python, PHP, VBScript, VBA, and SQLite. I see challenges as learning opportunities, which motivates me to adapt any technology that can better fulfill the requirements of a given project.</p>

	<h3>Where do I share what I learn & develop?</h3>
	<p>As a developer who tries to keep up with the current status quo, I see no other practice that's better than writing what I learn. That's why I try to spare time to write tutorials, articles, essays, and other writings about the technologies that I'm currently working with and technologies that I'm learning. You can <a href="/blog">read my blog</a> to access all my writings.</p>

	<h3>How can you contact me?</h3>
	<p>People say that I'm quite approachable, but everything's better when tested. So send an email in my way. Perhaps we can chat about a requirement of your business, a startup idea that you have, a website that you want to build, some prime developer memes that you want to share, or anything! (well, not <em>anything</em>)</p>
